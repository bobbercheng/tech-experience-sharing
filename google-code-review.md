# Code review

For the Code Review interview, you will be asked to review lines of code and asked for your thoughts on style, idiomacy, efficiency, and correctness of the code in question. As part of the interview, you will be encouraged to make suggestions on how to improve the code. The interview will be interactive. You’re welcome to ask clarifying questions but also expect to make some assumptions about the purpose of the code.

What makes a good code review interview?

  

-   Good self-directed problem solving skills exploring trade offs.
    

  

-   Focus open ended problems towards proactive and practical solutions.
    

  

-   Be confident in discussing the underlying  problems with the code, including issues of performance, complexity, or correctness. Avoid pointing out individual errors line by line and instead focus on the pattern of problem(s) you’re seeing in the code.
    

  

-   If writing code, show that you had a previous level of mastery and can return to that level quickly.
    

  

-   Demonstrate basic knowledge of core language libraries (even if lacking some immediate details.)
    

Additional areas to review or consider (note that the prep for Coding and Code Review interviews can overlap):

  

-   Do you think like an engineer? How do you think logically to accomplish a programming task? We're looking for evidence of your past as a strong coder.
    

  

-   Do you make good choices around which data structures to use for different problems?
    

  

-   Can you identify underlying problems and issues of performance in code?
    

  

-   Can you identify good style, idiomacy, efficiency, and correctness in code?
    

  

-   Do you have basic knowledge of core language libraries?
    

  

-   Things we are lenient on: syntax errors, unidiomatic use of the language, library routines, if it takes you more time to get started with solving a problem.
    

  

-   To prepare, practice coding exercises similar to [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)  and [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/#/).
    

  

-   Also, the book, [“Cracking the Coding Interview”](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) can be a helpful resource.
    

  

-   You can also review the [Google style guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/) for the respective languages as well as know and understand the important parts of the standard libraries for each language:
    

  

-   [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)
    

  

-   [Overview (Java Platform SE 8 )](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html)
    

  

-   [C++ STL](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
    

  

-   Some books to consider (as applicable):
    

  

-   C++: [Effective Modern C++](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-modern-c/9781491908419/)
    

  

-   Java: [Effective Java](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java-3rd/9780134686097/)
    

  

-   Python: [Fluent Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/) or [Effective Python](https://effectivepython.com/)

It is a good idea to practise writing code in preparation as well as reading code, and also reviewing the Google style guides for the respective languages.
