- Granularity optimization (cluster numbers, time windows)
- Feature consistency between training and serving
- Missing data handling
- Data freshness & latency: ensuring near real-time updates
- Feature Drift: Models degrading due to distribution shifts
- High storage & Compute Cost: Managing petabytes of data efficiently
- Dependency Management: Tracking feature lineage across teams

## GPU Cluster Performance Optimization
### Model Optimization
- Quantization (FP32 -> FB16 or INT8 for reducing memory footprint)
- Pruning (Removing unnecessary layers/weights)
- Knowledge distillation (training smaller models with teacher guidance)

### Efficient Execution
- TensorRT/ONNX Runtime: converts model for optimized GPU inference
- Caching and batching: Combines multiple requests to maximize throughput
- Asynchronous execution: avoid idle GPU time

### Scaling
- Triton Inference servers: Enables multi-GPU and multi-model serving
- Kubernetes + GPU Auto-scaling: Deploys dynamic inference workloads efficiently

## LLM Inference Challenges
### Performance Challenges
- High latency
  - Large models require substantial compute
  - Solutions: KV cache optimization, speculative decoding
- Memory constraints
  - Hosting LLMs requires high VRAM (A100)
  - Solutions: Model partitioning, CPU/RAM offloading
- Scalability & Cost
  - Running inference at scale is expensive
  - Solutions: MoE (Mixture of Experts), distillation (small models like LLama-7B)
- Token Streaming & Throughput
  - Autoregressive decoding is slow for real-time applications
  - Solutions: FlashAttention, transformer batching
- Latency and flexibility trade-off
- Guardrails control
